In the MACROSS PLUS video game, the player not only controls the fighter but also the pilot. With the YF-19 and the YF-21, obviously the pilots are Isamu Dyson and Guld Bowman, respectively. Interestingly, the pilot of the VF-11 is a woman, yet nameless to all available sources. People's sneaking suspicion that this is actually an updated Komilia Jenius, first daughter of Max and Milia Jenius and star of the PC-Engine game  SUPER DIMENSIONAL FORTRESS MACROSS 2036
